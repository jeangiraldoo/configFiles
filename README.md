### Welcome to My Config Files!
Hi there! In this repository, I'll be storing the configuration files for the software I use. Feel free to check them out or use them if they fit your needs. If you have any questions or need help, don't hesitate to reach out!

### Configuration File Management and Installation Automation

I've created the installationScript.py file to automate the management and installation of my configuration files. While it's a bit rudimentary at the moment, it suits my needs. I'll continue working on it with the goal of making it a general-purpose configuration file automation tool, rather than just a script tailored to my specific needs.
